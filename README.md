Job-Search-React project named Indeed. 
This application is used for searching jobs, by calling an API which is given specific parameters like: job category, company name and/or job location. 
The API responds with an array of jobs that is afterwords paginated. Every job contains an apply button, which once clicked, will open the apply section where personal information can be inputed. 
As technologies, I used Axios for geting the API, React-Boot-Strapt for pagination, buttons, badges, collapse, etc, and React hooks like useState, useReaducer, useEffect.
